1. Download the dataset
   Download and extract the UCI HAR Dataset file.
        
2. Assign each data to variables
   features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns The features selected for this database come from accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals tAcc-XYZ and                                                                            tGyro-XYZ.
   activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 column List of activities performed when the measurements were taken, code as well
   subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
   x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns contains recorded features test data
   y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column contains test data of activities’code labels
   subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
   x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns contains recorded features train data
   y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column contains train data of activities’code labels

3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
   X (10299 rows, 561 columns) merges x_train and x_test using rbind() function
   Y (10299 rows, 1 column) merges y_train and y_test using rbind() function
   Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) merges subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
   Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) merges Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

 4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
    TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) subsets Merged_Data, which selects only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each

 5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Numbers are replaced with their corresponding actibity.

 6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
    changed tidydata to activities
    changed acc to accelerometer
    changed gyro to gyroscope
    changed bodybody to body
    changed mag to magnitutde
    changed f to frequency
    changed t to time

 7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
    FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) summarized TidyData taking the means of each variable and then grouped by subject and activity.
    Exported FinalData into FinalData.txt file for submission.
